FIND THE MOST OCCURED ELEMENT

Most occured element: A most occured element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Write a function which takes an array and emits the most occured element (if it exists), otherwise prints NONE.
